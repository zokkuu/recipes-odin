    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Everybody love Spaghetti and especially Spaghetti Bolognese.</p>
    <p>Let me show you this excellent variant with a meaty sauce and a smidge of tomatoes!</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 table spoons of sunflower oil</li>
        <li>1 big onion</li>
        <li>50g of bacon</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>750g of minced meat</li>
        <li>800g of tomatoes</li>
        <li>500g of Spaghetti</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large, wide saucepan and fry the onion cut into small cubes. </li>
        <li>Add the minced meat to the casserole, separating it into small pieces and sear until browned.</li>
        <li>Add a teaspoon of sugar and tomato paste, stir and saut√© for a minute. Then add the chopped tomatoes and their juices to the pot, season with salt, pepper, oregano and bay leaves.</li>
        <li>Bring to the boil, turn the heat down to low and simmer for 2-3 hours with the lid ajar, stirring occasionally. The sauce will thicken and darken, if it burns, cover with a little water and transfer to a smaller burner.</li>
        <li>Serve tossed with cooked spaghetti and sprinkled with grated parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Once cooled, you can divide the remaining sauce into individual portions and freeze for stock.</li>
