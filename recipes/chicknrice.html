        <li>
            Toss the chicken breast with garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Heat olive oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Add chicken breast and cook until browned, stirring often, about 3 minutes. Add garlic to skillet and cook for 30 seconds more.

            Stir in rice and chicken broth. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cover. Cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove pan from heat and place baby spinach on top of the rice. Cover and let sit for 5 minutes.
